## Grain Boundary Generator - Command line tool

Boundary between two crystal surfaces in a poly-crystal materials are referred as grain boundary.
To study these surfaces using experiments is almost impossible considering the size and complexity of the experiments.

*Molecular dynamics* is a tool used in *computational material science* to explore more about the material properties. 

The build python *command line tool* will generate the .txt files based on the input parameters given. 
These text files are used further for the *computer simulations* to predict the properties.
